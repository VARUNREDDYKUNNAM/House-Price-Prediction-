# House Price Prediction Project - BY varunreddykunnam, G01476214

## Project Overview
This project will apply several machine learning models in the prediction of house prices. These house prices can be determined by different features that may describe the houses, such as location and size. The regression models to predict actual prices, classification to classify houses into higher or lower categories based on median, and clustering for discovering patterns in housing data are applied in this project.

### Objectives
- Regression Model: Predict the actual prices of the houses.
- Classification Model: Categorize houses into 'above median' and 'below median' price categories.
- Clustering Model: Group houses based on similarities in features.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several packages related to data science.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package installer)
